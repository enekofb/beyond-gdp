## Why we are needed

**Limitations of GDP**

There are several limitations of GDP as a welfare indicator. 
Most of them can be traced back to the fact that in essence GDP is not supposed to measure well-being. As a result the concept does not account for various important factors that influence social welfare. 
To keep things simple the most relevant limitations are listed below:

- GDP does not incorporate any measures of welfare
- GDP only includes market transactions
- GDP does not describe income distribution
- GDP does not describe what is being produced
- GDP ignores externalities

**Alternatives to GDP**

At the back of 2008 global financial markets, different initiatives where developed to 
overtake the limitation of measuring progress in our societies via rely in just GDP growth. 

A non-exhaustive list of efforts includes 

* Index of Human Development (HDI)
* Human Poverty Index (HPI)
* Gross Domestic Happiness (GDH)
* Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW)
* Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)
* Happy Planet Index – measure of environmental efficiency for supporting well-being
* Green gross domestic product (green GDP or GGDP)
* Median income – (average wages)
* Well-Being index
